## Key traits of Artless Development

Artless Development (AD) is:

- Loosely constrained: AD is vision and practice, but neither a theory nor a framework.
- Familiar: ideas behind AD are neither novel nor unique, but known and even actively applied in software engineering for a long time, some for decades.
- Ad-hoc: AD is not suitable for every project and/or team.
- Objectivity-first: AD challenges software artisanry by reducing impact of subjectivity and human factor on core project activities.
- Uniting: AD helps to marry requirements to deliverables by providing common ground for communication between stakeholders, analysts, QA, developers, and managers.
- Tooling-independent: AD doesnâ€™t require any special fancy tooling and can work just fine with those common means used widely in development.
- Tooling-friendly: AD can be easily enriched with simple custom-built tools to achieve more transparency and visibility through automation.
